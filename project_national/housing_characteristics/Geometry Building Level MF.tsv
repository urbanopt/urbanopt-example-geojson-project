# Created by: sources\recs\recs2009\tsv_maker.py
# Description: Location of the multi-family unit vertically within the building (bottom, middle, top).
# Source: Calculated directly from other distributions
# Assumption: Calculated using the number of stories, where buildings >=2 stories have Top and Bottom probabilities = 1/Geometry Stories, and Middle probabilities = 1 - 2/Geometry stories
